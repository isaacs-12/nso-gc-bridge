hidapi>=0.14.0
pyusb>=1.2.0

# BLE support (for --ble flag, e.g. wireless NSO controller not visible as HID):
bleak>=0.21.0

# GUI option (install one of these for --gui flag):
# Option 1: For tkinter GUI (part of Python stdlib, but may need installation on macOS)
#   On macOS: brew install python-tk
#
# Option 2: For PyQt5 GUI (alternative, installs via pip)
#   pip install PyQt5
#   Then uncomment the line below:
# PyQt5>=5.15.0

# DSU server support (for Dolphin):
# No additional dependencies needed - uses standard library (socket, struct, zlib)
# Works on all platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows

# Virtual gamepad (normal controller without DSU, for --virtual-gamepad):
# Windows: pip install vgamepad  (requires ViGEmBus: https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases)
# Linux:   pip install evdev     (Linux only; needs kernel headers. May need: sudo usermod -aG input $USER)
# macOS:   pip install pyautogui  (keyboard emulation for games that support keyboard; not a real virtual gamepad)
#         For a real virtual HID gamepad on Mac you would need foohid (unsupported kext, not recommended)
